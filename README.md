# cbmbasic - Commodore BASIC V2 as a scripting language

"Commodore BASIC" (cbmbasic) is a 100% compatible version of Commodore's version of Microsoft BASIC 6502 as found on the Commodore 64. You can use it in interactive mode or pass a BASIC file as a command line parameter.

This source does not emulate 6502 code; all code is completely native. On a 1 GHz CPU you get about 1000x speed compared to a 1 MHz 6502.

## Compatibility

It has been tested with

* Mac OS X 10.4/10.5 i386/x86_64/ppc (GCC 3.3/4.0)
* Debian Linux Etch (GCC 3.3/4.1)
* Windows NT (Visual Studio 2005/2008)

Other CPUs, operating systems and compilers should work, too.

Windows users should also install the [Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 SP1 Redistributable Package (x86)]("http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=200b2fd9-ae1a-4a14-984d-389c36f85647&displaylang=en").

## Usage
You can use cbmbasic in interactive mode by just running the binary without parameters, or you can specify an ASCII-encoded BASIC program on the command line. You can also use cbmbasic as a UNIX scripting language by adding a hashbang line to your BASIC program and making it executable.

    $ ls -l hello.bas 
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 mist  staff  40  7 Apr 21:30 hello.bas
    $ cat hello.bas 
    #!/usr/bin/env cbmbasic
    PRINT"HELLO WORLD!"
    $ ./hello.bas 
    HELLO WORLD!

cbmbasic implements a small plugin system that lets developers add additional statements and functions. It is enabled automatically; use `SYS 0` to disable it and `SYS 1` to re-enable it. The original extensions include LOCATE *y*, *x* (set cursor position), SYSTEM *string* (run command line command), and extended WAIT *port*, *mask*, which implements the [Bill Gates easter egg](http://www.pagetable.com/?p=43).

An optional SDL2 build adds `BEEP frequency,duration` (20-20000 Hz and
1-5000 ms), `FRAME "title","message"` (a modal message box) or
`FRAME x1,y1,x2,y2,color` (a rectangle outline), and graphics
statements `SCREEN`, `CLS`, `TITLE`, `CSET`, `RECT x1,y1,x2,y2,color`,
`PSET`, `BEGINFRAME`,
`ENDFRAME`, `ANTIALIAS`, `LSET`, `FSET`, `LINE`, `CIRCLE`, `ELLIPSE`, `ARC`,
`TRIANGLE`, `GPRINT`, `ALERT`, and `SLEEP`. `SCREEN 1` through `SCREEN 3`
open a pixel canvas; `SCREEN 0` closes it. Logical canvas sizes are 800x400
times the selected mode. `PEEK(1038)`/`PEEK(1040)` report the base dimensions,
`PEEK(1042)` the selected mode, and `PEEK(1024)` the latest key or mouse event.
Run `test/graphics.bas` as a smoke test.

Install SDL2 development files and `pkg-config` first (on Ubuntu/Debian:
`sudo apt install libsdl2-dev pkg-config`), then build with
`make clean && make SDL=1`. The Makefile checks this dependency and prints an
installation hint when it is missing. The default build has no SDL dependency; SDL
statements report an error unless support is enabled. The extension parser is
enabled automatically; `SYS 0` disables it and `SYS 1` re-enables it. For the
legacy Windows makefile, set `SDL2DIR` to the SDL2
development package directory when invoking `nmake`; override `SDL2_LIBDIR`
if the SDL2 import library is not under `lib\x86`. Place `SDL2.dll` beside
the resulting executable.

`test/olivia9.bas` enables the extensions itself. Run it from the test
directory with `cd test && ../cbmbasic olivia9.bas`; `PORTRT10.DAT` is in
that directory.

## Internals
The core of the BASIC interpreter is in the file `cbmbasic.c`, which is platform, endianness and bitness independent. For all I/O, it calls out into `runtime.c`, so it should be possible to adapt this project for any OS by just changing `runtime.c`.

All function calls that the core interpreter can't handle end up in kernal_dispatch() in `runtime.c`, where a switch statement dispatches these to C functions. For Commodore BASIC, `runtime.c` has to support several Commodore KERNAL library routines. Some of them are very important (CHRIN, CHROUT) and some are only used for certain BASIC statements (LOAD, SAVE, OPEN, SETTIM). `runtime.c` does not implement all functions yet.
